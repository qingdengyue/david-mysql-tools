# Record logical and physical reads in InnoDB

= Introduction =

Show logical and physical reads in InnoDB. Physical reads means page reads from disk. Logical reads means page reads in InnoDB, including page reads from buffer pool and disk. This patch adds these IO statistics into slow log and MySQL profiler. Moreover, this patch can record SQL, whose logical reads is greater than a predefined value, into slow log file.


= Example =
* record SQL query to slow log *

* IO statistics in profiler
{{{
